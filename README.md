<h1> Warfarin-Dosing-Prediction</h1>

<h3><mark>Introduction:</mark></h3>
<p>Warfarin, a widely used anticoagulant, presents challenges in dosing due to inter-individual variability influenced by genetic, clinical, and environmental factors. This variability calead to adverse effects such as bleeding or clotting if the dosage isn't tailored correctly.To address this issue, we're leveraging machine learning to predict optimal dosages for individual patients, aiming to improve treatment outcomes and minimize risks. Warfarin is a tricky medication to dose because it needs to be just right for each person to avoid side effects like bleeding or clotting. Figuring out the perfect dose for someone is tough because it depends on their genes, age, and health issues. We're using machine learning to create personalized dosage predictions by analyzing patient data. This report explains how we're doing it, from preparing the data to testing different models and checking how accurate they are.</p>

<h3><mark> Our methodology involves several key steps:</mark></h3>

<h2><mark>Data Preprocessing:</mark></h2> 
<p>We start by collecting comprehensive patient data, including genetic profiles, clinical information, and environmental factors. This data is often messy and requires cleaning and normalization to ensure consistency and accuracy. Feature Selection: Not all variables in the dataset may be relevant for predicting warfarin dosage. We employ feature selection techniques to identify the most informative features that contribute to dosage variability. Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms such as regression or ensemble methods, we train predictive models on the preprocessed data. These models learn patterns from the data and develop algorithms to predict optimal warfarin dosages based on patient characteristics.</p>

<h2><mar>Evaluation:</mar></h2>
<p>We rigorously evaluate the performance of our models using various metrics such as mean absolute error or coefficient of determination. This helps us assess how well the models generalize to unseen data and whether they provide accurate dosage predictions. By following this methodology, we aim to develop robust and reliable predictive models for warfarin dosage optimization. Ultimately, our goal is to provide clinicians with a valuable tool that assists in prescribing personalized dosages, thereby improving patient safety and treatment efficacy.</p>

<h2><mar>Methods:</mar></h2>
<p>Data Acquisition and Processing: The dataset containing patient demographic information, genetic variants, and therapeutic dose of Warfarin is obtained and processed using Python's pandas library. Features are standardized using StandardScaler and missing values are handled appropriately. Multicollinearity Assessment: Multicollinearity among features is assessed using correlation matrices, and highly correlated features are identified and removed to improve model performance. Feature Selection: Feature selection is performed based on provided instruction that helps to identify the most relevant features for dosage prediction. Machine Learning Methods: Various regression algorithms including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Regressor, Neural Network, Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, and XGBoost Regressor are trained and evaluated. Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared score, mean squared error, and mean absolute error on training, validation, and test sets.</p>

<h2><mar>Results:</mar></h2>
<p></p>Model Selection and Parameter Tuning: We employed cross-validation for model selection and parameter tuning, ensuring robustness and generalizability of our models. This approach allowed us to systematically explore hyperparameter spaces and identify the optimal settings for each machine learning method. </p>

<h2><mar>Testing Sets:</mar></h2>
<p>Our models exhibited varying performance across datasets, as depicted in the tables and graphs below. Linear regression demonstrated strong interpretability and performed well on the training and validation sets. However, it showed some signs of overfitting on the testing set. Conversely, the KNN regressor captured complex non-linear relationships and displayed promising results on all sets.</p>

<h2><mar>Evalulation Metrics:</mar></h2>
<p>We utilized various evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess model performance. The tables and graphs below summarize the MSE, RMSE, MAE, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared values for each model.</p>

<h2><mar>Discussions:</mar></h2>
<p>Our results underscore the importance of thoughtful feature selection, model interpretability, and the application of regularization techniques. While linear regression provided valuable insights due to its interpretability, the KNN regressor showcased the ability to capture complex relationships within the data. However, both models exhibited areas for improvement, such as addressing overfitting in the case of linear regression and fine-tuning the KNN algorithm to enhance its performance further.</p>

<h2><mar>Future Works:</mar></h2>
<p>Moving forward, we aim to explore advanced techniques like ensemble learning and neural networks to potentially improve model performance. Additionally, we plan to delve deeper into feature engineering and regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and enhance generalization capabilities. By addressing these areas, we believe we can build more robust and accurate predictive models for our application. By combining cross-validation for model selection and parameter tuning, presenting results on
training, validation, and testing sets, utilizing comprehensive evaluation metrics, and engaging in detailed discussions on results and future work, our project provides a thorough analysis of machine learning methods for regression tasks.</p>

<h2><mar>Conclusions:</mar></h2>
<p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learningtechniques to predict the therapeutic dose of Warfarin based on patient characteristics. While some models achieved promising results, further optimization and exploration of advanced algorithms are warranted. Future work may involve integrating additional clinical variables, refining feature selection methods, and incorporating genetic data to enhance prediction accuracy.</p>
