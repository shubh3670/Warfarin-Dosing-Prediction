# Warfarin-Dosing-Prediction

In this project, we aim to develop an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting the optimal dosage of warfarin critical medication used to prevent thromboembolism in patients with various medical conditions. By leveraging domain knowledge and expert insights, we will carefully select relevant features and interpret the model's output. Continuous updates to the model with new patient data are essential to adapt to changing patient populations and treatment protocols. Moreover, compliance with regulatory standards and ethical considerations regarding patient data privacy and security is paramount. Ultimately, this project will empower healthcare providers to prescribe warfarin doses more accurately, optimizing therapy for patients while minimizing risks associated with under or overdosing.
